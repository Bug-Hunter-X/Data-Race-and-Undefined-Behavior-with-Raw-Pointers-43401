This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving raw pointers and data races. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify data through a raw pointer after the data's ownership has changed, which can cause undefined behavior or crashes.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that avoids this problem by using safe Rust features and preventing data races.
